- Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google and its parent company, Alphabet, rising to the top after proving his medal as a talented product leader and peacemaker
- He runs a tech giant that functions more like a micro country, overseeing businesses such as YouTube, DeepMind, Cloud, and, of course, Search
- ChatGPT set off an industry-wide fever pitch over AI not seen since dot-com boom
- Pichai: "Time flies by
- You know, I had my kids right when I started Google too, so the whole thing just flew by" Microsoft and OpenAI's chatbot seemingly knocked Google off its perch
- It was April Fool's Day 2004
- There was rumor
- Gmail apparently had launched
- So all my interviews were about Gmail
- And it definitely wasn't a joke? They launched it
- They actually launched it, yeah
- But I never allow, no products on April fool's Day
- I think it's too confusing
- You're gonna feel that excitement, that frenzy, but I think we are prepared for it
- So you kind of roll with the flow, you embrace it
- We still have long ways to go, but we are in the early stages of that
- everything is happening everywhere, all at once
- CEO: "I perceived our life through the arrival of gadgets
- I never took technology for granted
- I felt this quest for learning knowledge, et cetera
- ys resonated very deeply with me" He says he's optimistic about how technology can make a difference
- Larry says he talks to Larry regularly with Sergey and Larry regularly
- Sergey is spending more time in the office working on AI, Larry says
- Larry: "Some of my fondest memories over the last year is sitting with Sergey on large screen looking at lost curves as we train these models"  The decisions Pichai and Google make influence how billions of people get information
- The nature of how users get information is starting to change in the age of AI
- This seems like a threat to Google, except the core technology being used by Google's competitors was invented by Google itself
- Some leading computer scientists have said Search is getting worse, more SEO spam, et cetera
- Google Search will always link to a wide variety of sources, and AI is going to do that in the future
- But it'll always be an important part of Search, and the links will live on, he says
- Google is rolling out Gemini AI chatbot chatbot
- Gemini initially generated images of Asian Nazis and Black founding fathers
- The chatbot is giving you answers and not links, and maybe more answers than links sometimes
- Google makes a ton of money on ads next to the links generated by searches
- People are calling this woke AI, and it's not just happening here, it's happening across the industry
- How did the model generate something that it never saw? We are a company which serves products to users around the world, and there are generic questions
- How do you get it right?  The challenge for everyone is how do you have a notion of what's objective and real in a world where there's gonna be a lot of synthetic content? I think it's part of what will define Search in the next decade ahead, right? People often come to Google right away to see whether something they saw on the site actually happen
- Microsoft's ChatGPT is a new artificial intelligence program
- Microsoft's AI research is talent in driving the next generation of breakthroughs
- Microsoft CEO: "We are investing a lot of [AI] resources
- We are in the process of making breakthroughs," he says
- CEO: "I think the larger the company is, you are making fewer decisions, but they need to be clear" "You build consensus because that's what allows you to have maximum impact behind those decisions," he says
- "I'm not gonna make the mean tweets like they do on "Late Night," but I do have a few."  Google CEO says it's a privilege to lead the company
- He says he sees a dinosaur statue in the distance, which he thinks is a good reminder
- "Google doesn't have one â€” not a single visionary leader, not a one," he says
- Google I/O is sort of a state of the Google Union, the CEO says
- It's less about, you know, particular product, more about the journey we are on, the vision we have for how AI can transform our products, he says
- How should we think about Alphabet today? What is the new Google? When you take big, large-scale bets, by definition, you're not aiming big enough if you don't have a few failures
- Google created this bottoms up culture where everyone has a voice, and it's super transparent, and the perks are great too
- Google fired Google employees who were protesting a contract with the Israeli government for cloud services
- It seemed like a distinctchange in tone for a company that's historically welcoming all kinds of views
- The opportunity we have ahead of us is immense, but it needs a real focus on our mission
- Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says there is a lot of competition in the AI space
- Microsoft is making huge investments in AI as well as OpenAI, Inflection, Mistral
- Satya: "The way you stay ahead is by innovating relentlessly"  Google is facing a ton of regulatory pressure in the US, abroad, over its dominance in Search, video, ads, the app store
- Some other big companies have split themselves up to focus on their core
- A lot of our products integrate in a way that provides value for our users
- I think with AI, you get a chance to rethink that experience over the next few years
- I still see the center of where the AI innovation will happen in smartphones, followed by glasses, right? That's how I see it
- I would expect, over time, there needs to be engagement with China on important issues like AI safety
- Google is committed to making foundational progress towards AGI in a 'bold and responsible way' Will AI always be somewhat in a black box? I think, you know, humansare very mysterious, too
- Today, we can't make sense of many complex systems
- AI will give us more insights
- CEO Sam Altman: Why should we trust Google? "No one, you shouldn't blind lead, you know? That's why it's important to have systems in place
- Regulation has a part to play, but as these AI systems get more capable, it shouldn't just be based on a system of trust people or trust companies
- There's no reason we wouldn't scale up our computing a hundred-thousand times in a few years
- I hope some of this looks like a toy in the future, I hope it is that way, otherwise otherwise, otherwise, we didn't do our job well .
